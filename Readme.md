# by Disane

# Description:
Simple blockchain data structure used in a Node.js Web App to create blockchain nodes for mining and processing blockchain transactions. There's also a simple block explorer attached to the project. 
This particular blochain utilizes:
* Proof of work to create and validate a new block.
* Longest chain to conduct blockchain integrity checks.

The code is based on Eric Traub's Udemy course:

# TODO:
>Before you implement the end points for your wallet Web or Mobile App make sure that you complete all the improvements that are suggested by Eric at the end of this course. 

>>1. Transactions need to check whether the provided address has at least the amount of cryptocurrency assigned to it before proceeding.

>>2. You need to secure all inputs that may come from the outside.â€‹ Check all the arguments that you pass to your end points and blockchain member functions. 
This is necessary to make the blockchain bulletproof against various hack attempts.
